Timestamp Integrity

Project: 3I / ATLAS (C/2025 N1)

This document enumerates known, high-risk timestamp failure modes when aligning MPC/MPEC astrometric observations with JPL Horizons (W50) ephemeris data. It is intentionally pre-calculation and focuses only on data interpretation, normalization, and alignment risks.

1. Time Standards Involved

1.1 MPEC / MPC Observation Times

Reported in UTC

Precision is observational, not mathematical

Often recorded as:

Date + fractional day, or

HH:MM:SS with limited decimals



Important: MPC timestamps represent reported observation times, not guaranteed mid-exposure instants unless explicitly stated.


---

1.2 JPL Horizons / W50 Ephemeris Times

Computed in TDB (Barycentric Dynamical Time)

Arbitrary numerical precision

Continuous mathematical evaluation points


Important: Horizons times are not observational records and do not encode shutter timing or exposure duration.


---

2. Fundamental Mismatch

MPEC and Horizons data differ in both time scale and precision semantics:

MPEC	Horizons

UTC	TDB
Observational precision	Arbitrary precision
Discrete	Continuous
Human-reported	Dynamical computation


For a fast interstellar object (~65–70 km/s):

1 second ≈ 65–70 km

0.1 sec ≈ 6–7 km

1 ms ≈ 65–70 meters


Small timestamp misinterpretations can therefore create meaningful angular residuals.

3. Known Timestamp Failure Modes

3.1 UTC ↔ TDB Conversion Errors

Failure Mode

Treating UTC timestamps as if already TDB

Applying conversion inconsistently or implicitly


Effect

Systematic residual offsets

Apparent along-track acceleration


Mitigation

Perform UTC → TDB conversion in exactly one documented step

Preserve original timestamps unchanged


Recommended Columns

timestamp_utc_original

timestamp_tdb_converted

timestamp_used_for_match



---

3.2 Fractional Day Parsing Errors

Failure Mode

Misinterpreting MPC fractional days

Off-by-one-day boundary errors


Effect

Minute-to-hour misalignments

Catastrophic but sometimes subtle


Mitigation

Normalize all MPC times to ISO-8601 UTC strings

Manually spot-check several random rows



---

3.3 Over-Precision Illusion

Failure Mode

Matching coarse observation times against high-precision ephemeris values

Treating interpolated values as more precise than the observation supports


Effect

Noise masquerading as signal

Artificially inflated confidence


Mitigation

Never interpolate or compare beyond observational time precision

Treat time uncertainty as an explicit error source



---

3.4 Interpolation Step Misalignment

Failure Mode

Interpolating between ephemeris steps without validating curvature effects


Effect

Small but systematic RA/DEC biases


Mitigation

Use bracketing ephemeris points for validation

Confirm interpolation deltas are within expected timing uncertainty



---

3.5 Exposure Timing Ambiguity

Failure Mode

Assuming reported time equals mid-exposure


Effect

Directional residual bias correlated with observatory


Mitigation

Default assumption: reported time ≈ mid-exposure

Document this assumption explicitly



---

4. Timestamp Validation Checklist

Before performing residual calculations:

1. Confirm MPEC timestamps are UTC


2. Confirm Horizons timestamps are TDB


3. Verify a single explicit UTC→TDB conversion step


4. Preserve original timestamps unchanged


5. Validate fractional day parsing


6. Limit interpolation to observational precision


7. Validate against bracketing ephemeris


8. Document exposure-time assumptions



If all checks pass, timestamp integrity is considered sound.

5. Scope Note

This document addresses timestamp integrity only. It does not assess:

Astrometric calculations

Residual computation

Sigma or covariance interpretation


Those concerns are handled in separate documents.
