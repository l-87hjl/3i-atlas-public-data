INTERPOLATION_INTEGRITY.md

Scope

This document enumerates non-mathematical failure modes associated with time interpolation between JPL Horizons ephemeris outputs and MPC/MPEC astrometric observations for 3I / C/2025 N1 (ATLAS). It is intended to prevent silent logic errors before any residuals or conclusions are computed.

This document assumes:

MPC/MPEC observations are authoritative for observation timestamps

JPL Horizons ephemerides are authoritative for modeled positions

Residuals require mapping the two onto a common temporal frame



---

1. Bracketing vs Interpolated Ephemerides

Description

There are two fundamentally different ephemeris strategies:

Bracketing ephemeris: raw Horizons outputs at fixed cadence (e.g., 1 min, 5 min)

Interpolated ephemeris: positions computed between two Horizons timestamps


These are not interchangeable.

Failure Mode

Treating interpolated values as if they were raw Horizons outputs

Forgetting that interpolation introduces assumptions about motion smoothness


What to Check

Confirm whether a row originated from Horizons directly or from interpolation logic

Ensure interpolated rows are explicitly labeled as such

Never mix raw and interpolated rows without metadata



---

2. Linear Interpolation Assumptions

Description

Most pipelines default to linear interpolation in RA and DEC.

This assumes:

Constant angular velocity over the interval

No curvature in apparent motion over that time span


This assumption degrades as:

Cadence increases (e.g., >1 minute)

Object velocity increases (true for 3I)

Topocentric effects dominate


Failure Mode

Using linear interpolation over too-long intervals

Applying the same interpolation tolerance everywhere


What to Check

Interpolation interval length (seconds)

Object angular speed at that epoch

Whether interpolation error could rival or exceed reported sigma



---

3. Time Anchoring Errors

Description

Interpolation requires anchoring the observation timestamp between two ephemeris rows.

Failure Modes

Using the wrong bracketing rows

Off-by-one errors (selecting rows that do not actually bound the observation)

Interpolating outside the bracket due to rounding


What to Check

Observation timestamp must satisfy: t_left ≤ t_obs ≤ t_right

Bracketing rows must be consecutive in Horizons output

Time deltas must be computed in the same time scale (TDB)



---

4. Exposure-Time Ambiguity

Description

MPC timestamps typically represent:

Mid-exposure time (most common)

Occasionally start or end time (rare, but dangerous)


Horizons positions are instantaneous.

Failure Mode

Treating timestamp as instantaneous when it represents an exposure midpoint

Misaligning by ±(exposure/2)


What to Check

MPC observatory metadata for exposure conventions

Whether exposure durations are available or assumed

Whether mid-exposure assumption is documented and consistent



---

5. Precision Illusion During Interpolation

Description

Interpolated outputs often carry:

Full double-precision decimals

Artificially high apparent precision


This can exceed the actual temporal or astrometric precision of the source data.

Failure Mode

Treating interpolated decimals as meaningful at sub-millisecond or micro-arcsecond scales

Over-weighting tiny residuals that are interpolation artifacts


What to Check

Cap effective precision to MPC timestamp resolution

Track significant figures explicitly

Flag interpolated precision beyond data support



---

6. Coordinate-Space Interpolation Mistakes

Description

Interpolation must respect coordinate semantics:

RA is angular and wraps at 24h / 360°

DEC is linear


Failure Modes

Interpolating RA across wrap boundaries incorrectly

Interpolating RA instead of RA·cos(DEC)

Mixing degrees, hours, arcseconds during interpolation


What to Check

RA wrap handling

Unit normalization before interpolation

Consistent coordinate representation



---

7. Cadence Mismatch

Description

Using ephemerides at fixed cadence (e.g., 1 minute) to match irregular MPC timestamps.

Failure Mode

Assuming 1-minute cadence is always sufficient

Ignoring fast sky-plane motion


What to Check

Worst-case angular displacement per minute

Whether cadence should be tightened near close approaches



---

8. Interpolation Error vs Sigma Scale

Description

Interpolation error must be small relative to sigma, or it contaminates residuals.

Failure Mode

Residuals dominated by interpolation error rather than observational error


What to Check

Upper bound interpolation error estimate

Compare against 1σ and 3σ thresholds

Flag regimes where interpolation uncertainty is non-negligible



---

9. Required Metadata for Interpolated Rows

Every interpolated ephemeris row must carry:

Source ephemeris file ID

Left/right bracket timestamps

Interpolation method

Interpolation interval length

Time scale (TDB)


Missing metadata = unverifiable row.


---

10. Red Flags Checklist

🚩 Residuals improve when cadence tightens 🚩 Residuals correlate with time offset 🚩 Sub-sigma residual structure disappears when using raw Horizons times 🚩 Interpolated precision exceeds MPC timestamp precision

Status

This document addresses interpolation integrity only.

No conclusions about residuals, anomalies, or physical interpretation should be drawn until all checks here are satisfied.
