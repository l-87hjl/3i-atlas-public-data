Sigma Handling Integrity

Project: 3I / ATLAS (C/2025 N1)

This document enumerates high-risk failure modes in interpreting and applying JPL Horizons sigma uncertainty fields during plane-of-sky consistency checks. It is focused on correct field interpretation and data hygiene, not on validating any particular residual result.

1. What the Horizons “Sigmas” Are (and Are Not)

1.1 What they are

Formal propagated uncertainties derived from the orbit covariance of the referenced solution (e.g., Sol44).

Reported as ±3σ values (not 1σ).

Units: arcseconds.


1.2 What they are not

Not observational measurement errors.

Not evidence that a telescope was “wrong” if residuals exceed them.

Not guaranteed to bound reality if systematics / unmodeled forces exist.



---

2. Required Uncertainty Fields (W50 / Horizons)

For uncertainty-aware comparisons, you need the full ellipse set, not only axis-wise sigmas:

RA_3SIGMA (arcsec)

DEC_3SIGMA (arcsec)

SMAA_3SIG (arcsec)

SMIA_3SIG (arcsec)

THETA (deg)


Non-negotiable rule: RA_3SIGMA and DEC_3SIGMA must not be treated as independent, axis-aligned confidence bounds.

3. The Most Common Sigma Failure Modes

3.1 Using RA_3SIGMA / DEC_3SIGMA as an axis-aligned box

Failure Mode

Checking “|ΔRA| < RA_3SIGMA and |ΔDEC| < DEC_3SIGMA” as a 3σ test.


Why it breaks

RA and DEC uncertainties are generally correlated.

Horizons provides a rotated error ellipse for a reason.


Mitigation

Always use the ellipse (SMAA_3SIG, SMIA_3SIG, THETA) for pass/fail.



---

3.2 Mixing RA vs RA·cos(DEC)

Failure Mode

Using raw ΔRA (in arcsec) but comparing to a quantity that implicitly assumes ΔRA·cos(DEC), or vice versa.


Why it breaks

On the sky, the RA axis is scaled by cos(DEC). Without that scaling, the RA component is overstated at high |DEC|.


Mitigation

Choose one convention and lock it:

Plane-of-sky convention: treat the residual vector as (ΔRA·cosDEC, ΔDEC) in arcseconds.

Ensure the ellipse test uses the same convention.



Red flag

Residual magnitudes inflate with declination in a way that tracks 1/cos(DEC).



---

3.3 Misreading THETA orientation / rotation sign

Failure Mode

Treating THETA as counterclockwise when it is clockwise.

Rotating the residual vector in the wrong direction.


Correct definition

THETA is measured CLOCKWISE from the direction of increasing RA toward the semi-major axis, in the direction of increasing DEC.


Mitigation

Implement rotation once, then validate with a known synthetic test:

If THETA = 0, semi-major axis must align with +RA direction.

If THETA = 90, semi-major axis must align with +DEC direction.




---

3.4 Treating 3σ values as 1σ

Failure Mode

Plugging SMAA_3SIG and SMIA_3SIG into formulas that assume 1σ.


Mitigation

Decide which boundary you are testing:

3σ boundary test: use SMAA_3SIG, SMIA_3SIG directly.

1σ ellipse: divide both axes by 3.



Red flag

“Most points are outside 3σ” for a well-fit solution with dense observations—often indicates a scaling error.



---

3.5 Unit confusion (arcseconds vs degrees vs seconds-of-time)

Failure Mode

Converting sexagesimal RA residuals incorrectly.


Mitigation

Lock conversions:

1 hour of RA = 15 degrees

1 second of RA time = 15 arcseconds (of angle) before applying cos(DEC) scaling.



Red flag

Residuals off by factors near 15, 3600, or ~cos(DEC).

4. Correct “Inside the Ellipse” Test (Conceptual)

Given a plane-of-sky residual vector:

dx = ΔRA·cos(DEC) in arcseconds

dy = ΔDEC in arcseconds


Steps:

1. Rotate (dx, dy) by THETA (using the correct clockwise convention).


2. Normalize by ellipse axes:

u = dx_rot / SMAA_3SIG

v = dy_rot / SMIA_3SIG



3. Compute: rho = sqrt(u^2 + v^2)


4. Interpret:

rho < 1 → inside the 3σ ellipse

rho >= 1 → outside the 3σ ellipse




Note: this is a covariance-consistency check, not a proof of anomaly.

5. Data Integrity Checklist (Sigma Fields)

Before trusting any uncertainty-aware comparison:

1. Confirm the Horizons output actually includes:

RA_3SIGMA, DEC_3SIGMA, SMAA_3SIG, SMIA_3SIG, THETA



2. Confirm all sigma/ellipse axes are in arcseconds.


3. Confirm THETA is interpreted as clockwise.


4. Confirm your residual vector is consistently either:

(ΔRA·cosDEC, ΔDEC) or (ΔRA, ΔDEC) (and the ellipse math matches that choice).



5. Confirm you are treating the values as 3σ unless explicitly rescaled.


6. Spot-check a few rows:

SMAA_3SIG ≥ SMIA_3SIG (should generally hold)

THETA within a sensible range (typically 0–180 or 0–360 depending on output format)




If all checks pass, sigma-field handling is considered structurally sound.


---

6. Scope Note

This document does not validate:

whether a specific residual is correct

whether a given solution’s covariance is realistic

whether non-gravitational modeling is adequate


It only prevents misinterpretation of Horizons uncertainty fields.
